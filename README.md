# stm ( Simple Task Manager )

Full stack app responsive and reactive simple task manager using so many technologies
This app consist of two backends and three frontend it's not meant to use for productive
The purpose of this app is for training using so many technologies

This app is relying on restfull api backend I designed two backends to this project
The first is java backend using the Spring Boot, JPA and PostgresQL as database
and for the security the backend uses the power of Spring security and jsonwebtoken 
So this app is not only simple it's also secure
I also designed three frontends using ReactJS, Electron and Reac Native.


Let's explain...

Backends are 

1- [stm-java-backend](https://github.com/blacktoviche/stm-java-backend)  a backend uses the power of spring boot, rest, jpa and spring security using jsonwebtoken for login etc..
   the backend uses postgresql as database
   
2- [stm-express-backend](https://github.com/blacktoviche/stm-express-backend)a backend uses the power of ExpressJS, jsonwebtoken and mongodb as database 

Frontends are:

1- [stm-web](https://github.com/blacktoviche/stm-web)is a single page web app using the power of ReactJS (including Redux), Bootstrap and ChartJS

2- [stm-desktop](https://github.com/blacktoviche/stm-desktop)is desktop app using the power of Electron It's ( stm-web ) with some certain modefication
to fit into Electron 

3- [StmApp](https://github.com/blacktoviche/StmApp)is mobile app ( Android & iOS ) using the power of React Native ( including redux ) and Nativebase ( ReactNative components )

Most of the code is shared between the three frontends for the web & desktop versions it's almost the same
But it diferent for the mobile because using of ReactNative components but it shares so many code especially the one which connet to the backend

You can combine any frontend with any backend you don't have to change anything just run the backend you prefer
and run the frontend you prefer 

If you willing to try it go to the repositories and start gitting it

## Note
You can npm if you prefer but I think yarn is faster that's why I'm using it
